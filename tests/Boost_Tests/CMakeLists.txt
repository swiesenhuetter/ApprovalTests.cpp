# Hints for specifying Boost location:
# 1. It's possible to specify your Boost location on the CMake command line,
# for example:
#  -DBOOST_ROOT=/Users/clare/Documents/develop/tools/boost/boost_1_71_0/
# 2. In CLion, you can supply this argument in each of your CMake profiles, with:
#    Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> CMake -> 'CMake options:'

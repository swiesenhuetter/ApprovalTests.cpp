## Using Conan to obtain ApprovalTests.cpp

Some examples of using the [Conan package manager](https://conan.io/):

* Daniel Heater's [ApprovalTests-ConanDemo repo](https://github.com/dheater/ApprovalTests-ConanDemo)
    * This demonstrates using ApprovalTests.cpp with Conan's `cmake` generator in a `conanfile.txt` file.
* p-podsiadly's 
[ImageApprovals](https://github.com/p-podsiadly/ImageApprovals)
    * This shows a different approach, using Conan's `cmake_find_package` generator from purely CMake code.
    * It's also a nice example of extending ApprovalTests.cpp to compare images.

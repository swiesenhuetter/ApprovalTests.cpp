## Test gives "You have forgotten to configure your test framework..."

**Symptom**

Running tests gives the following output:

<!-- snippet: ForgottenToConfigure.HelpMessage.approved.txt -->

* Welcome to Approval Tests.
*
* You have forgotten to configure your test framework for Approval Tests.
*
* To do this in Catch, add the following to your main.cpp:
*
*     #define APPROVALS_CATCH
*     #include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
*
* To do this in Google Test, add the following to your main.cpp:
*
*     #define APPROVALS_GOOGLETEST
*     #include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
*
* To do this in doctest, add the following to your main.cpp:
*
*     #define APPROVALS_DOCTEST
*     #include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
*
* To do this in Boost.Test, add the following to your main.cpp:
*
*     #define APPROVALS_BOOSTTEST
*     #include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
*
* To do this in [Boost].UT, add the following to your main.cpp:
*
*     #define APPROVALS_UT
*     #include "ApprovalTests.hpp"

## Test gives "There seems to be a problem with your build configuration"

**Symptom 1: Compilation Error**

Compiling tests in Ninja-generated builds gives a compilation failure, with this message:

<!-- snippet: compiler_error_for_misconfigured_build -->
<a id='snippet-compiler_error_for_misconfigured_build'/></a>
```h
"There seems to be a problem with your build configuration, probably with Ninja. "
"Please visit https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp/blob/master/doc/TroubleshootingMisconfiguredBuild.md "
"The filename is: "
__FILE__
```

**Symptom 2: Test Failure**

Running tests in Ninja-generated builds gives output such as the following:

## My custom reporter works in development, but not CI

Check your test code - especially your main - for any uses of `Approvals::useAsFrontLoadedReporter()` that are specific to running on a Continuous Integration system.

If that's the case, and you do still want to use a custom reporter in an individual test, you can use `Approvals::useAsFrontLoadedReporter()` in the test, passing in your custom reporter, to take precedence over the CI-specific reporter in your main.

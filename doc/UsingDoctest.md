## Getting Started With doctest

The [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) test framework works well with Approval Tests.

**Note:** Approval Tests has some specific build requirements if it is built with the [Ninja build generator](https://ninja-build.org/). **If you use Ninja with Approval Tests, special care is needed when setting up builds**, to avoid compilation errors or test failures. If you have any problems with this, please see [Troubleshooting Misconfigured Build](/doc/TroubleshootingMisconfiguredBuild.md#top). <!-- include: include_ninja_warning_note. path: /doc/mdsource/include_ninja_warning_note.include.md -->

Doctest is similar to Catch, but claims to give faster compilation times.

### Requirements

Approval Tests for doctest requires that a file called the following is found:

<!-- snippet: required_header_for_doctest -->
<a id='snippet-required_header_for_doctest'/></a>
```h
#include <doctest/doctest.h>
```
<sup><a href='/ApprovalTests/integrations/doctest/DocTestApprovals.h#L15-L17' title='File snippet `required_header_for_doctest` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-required_header_for_doctest' title='Navigate to start of snippet `required_header_for_doctest`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

Approval Tests needs doctest version 2.3.4 or above.

### New Project

Create a file `main.cpp` and add just the following two lines:

<!-- snippet: doctest_main -->
<a id='snippet-doctest_main'/></a>
```cpp
// main.cpp:
#define APPROVALS_DOCTEST // This tells Approval Tests to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file
#include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
```
<sup><a href='/tests/DocTest_Tests/main.cpp#L1-L5' title='File snippet `doctest_main` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-doctest_main' title='Navigate to start of snippet `doctest_main`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

<!-- todo: document use of sections -->

### Existing Project - with your main()

If you have [supplied your own `main()` for doctest](hhttps://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/main.md#top), you will need to teach it how to supply test names to Approval Tests.

You should make the following additions to your own source file that contains `main()`.  

<!-- snippet: doctest_existing_main -->
<a id='snippet-doctest_existing_main'/></a>
```cpp
// Add these two lines to the top of your main.cpp file:
#define APPROVALS_DOCTEST_EXISTING_MAIN
#include "ApprovalTests.hpp"
```
<sup><a href='/examples/doctest_existing_main/main.cpp#L1-L5' title='File snippet `doctest_existing_main` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-doctest_existing_main' title='Navigate to start of snippet `doctest_existing_main`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

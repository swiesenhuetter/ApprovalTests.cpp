# Testing Combinations

toc

## When to use Combinations

You have a function that takes, for example, 3 parameters, and you want to test its behaviour with a bunch of different values for each of those parameters.

If you have only one parameter that you want to vary, check out [How to Test a Variety of Values for One Input](/doc/how_tos/TestAVarietyOfValues.md#top).

## Steps

1. Copy this starter text, and adjust for the number of inputs that you have.

snippet: CombinationsStartingPoint

2. Modify each input container for your chosen values.
3. Make sure each input type has an ostream operator<< (See [To String](/doc/ToString.md#how))
4. Run it, and make sure that you have your inputs wired up correctly.

If they are wired up correctly, you will see a file that looks like this: it is the left hand side of the file that matters at this point: all combinations of your own input values should be listed:

snippet: CombinationTests.CombinationsStartingPoint.approved.txt

5. Implement the body of your lambda
6. Make sure that your lambda's return value also has an ostream operator<<
7. Run it, and approve the output.

## The Basics

You can use `CombinationApprovals::verifyAllCombinations` to test the content of multiple containers.

This makes a kind of approval test matrix, automatically testing all combinations of a set of inputs. It's a powerful way to quickly get very good test coverage.

In this small example, all combinations of `{"hello", "world"}` and `{1, 2, 3}` are being used:

snippet: YouCanVerifyCombinationsOf2

The format is carefully chosen to show both inputs and outputs, to make the test results easy to interpret. The output looks like this:

snippet: CombinationTests.YouCanVerifyCombinationsOf2.approved.txt

For advice on effective formatting, see [To String](/doc/ToString.md#top). As you write out larger volumes of data in your approval files, experience has shown that the choice of layout of text in approval files can make a big difference to maintainability of tests, when failures occur.

### Passing in a Reporter

Note: Over releases, the position of the optional Reporter parameter to `verifyAllCombinations` has changed, as the code has evolved:

| Release  | Position of optional Reporter argument
|---|--|
| Before [v.6.0.0](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp/releases/tag/v.6.0.0) | The optional Reporter argument goes after all the inputs |
| In v.6.0.0 | The optional Reporter argument should be the **second** argument. |
| After v.6.0.0 | The optional Reporter argument should be the **first** argument. |

## C++ Language Versions

If you are using C++11, you will need to supply the exact parameter types to your lambda:
 
snippet: sample_combinations_of_three

If you are using C++14 or above, you can simplify this by using `auto` or `auto&` for the lambda parameters:

snippet: sample_combinations_of_three_with_auto

# Approving Results

toc

## Concept

Approving results just means saving the .approved file with your desired results.

We'll provide more explanation in due course, but, briefly, here are the most common approaches to do this.

### Via Diff Tool

Most diff tools have the ability to move text from left to right, and save the result.

### Via command line

If you use the clipboard reporter, it will create a command line to move the received file to the approved file for you.

Limitation: only one command at a time, currently.

### Via file rename

You can just rename the .received file to .approved.

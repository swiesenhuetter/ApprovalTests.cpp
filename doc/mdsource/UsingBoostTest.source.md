# Using Approval Tests With Boost.Test


toc

## Getting Started With Boost.Test

The [Boost.Test](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html) test framework works well with Approval Tests.

**Note:** this document assumes the reader is familiar with the Boost.Test framework.

### Requirements

Approval Tests for Boost.Test requires that you specify the `#include <.../unit_test.hpp>`  
This allows ApprovalTests to work with all the different configurations of boost.  

Approval Tests needs Boost.Test version 1.60.0 or above.

### Adding ApprovalTests to your Boost.Test

To enable any Boost.Test test files to use ApprovalTests,
find the corresponding entry point and  
add the following lines of code to your [Test module's entry point](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/adv_scenarios/entry_point_overview.html) 
after the boost headers:

snippet: boost_test_main

#### Understanding Boost.Test Entry points

A directory of Boost.Test source files can either have multiple or a single entry point[s]. 
The entry point is any file that will contain the line:

snippet: boost_test_entry_point

## Testing exception messages

Testing exceptions with Approval Tests is very easy. Simply pass in a call to the function (usually wrapped in a lambda). Approval tests will execute the code, catch the exception, and verify the exception's message, i.e. `exception.what()`.

The exception thrown must inherit `std::exception`.
